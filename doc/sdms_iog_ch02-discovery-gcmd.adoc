===== GCMD DIF

The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Directory Interchange Format (DIF) <<RD-16>> is a metadata standard that is widely used (e.g. by the Antarctic Metadata Directory) and that was the foundation for data management during the International Polar Year.
SDMS is supporting both DIF 10.2 (the latest version of the standard), and also older versions (DIF 9) although deprecated.

////
<<gcmd-dif-elements>> shows elements in GCMD DIF and whether these are **M**andatory, **R**ecommended or **O**ptional, as well as whether they are **U**nique (only one occurrence allowed) and require utilisation of **C**ontrolled vocabularies.

|Element |Description |GCMD |SDMS 

|Entry_ID |The *<Entry_ID>* is the unique document identifier of the metadata record. The *<Entry_ID>* is determined by the metadata author or data center contact personnel and may be identical to identifiers used by the data provider’s data center or organization. For example, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) identifies their metadata records as _NSIDC-xxxx_, where __xxxx __is a numerical designator. Also, the identifier is case insensitive meaning nsidc-xxxx and NSIDC-xxx refer to the same metadata record. |MU |MU

|Entry_Title |The <Entry_Title> is the title of the data set described
by the metadata. |MU |MU

|Parameters (Science Keywords) |The *<Parameters>* field allows for the specification of Earth science keywords that are representative of the data set being described. These keywords are important for the precise search and retrieval of information from the GCMD. The author must select these keywords from the controlled set of science keywords. The *<Parameters>* field consists of a 7-level hierarchical classification of science keywords |MC |MC

|ISO Topic Category |The *<ISO_Topic_Category>* field is used to identify the keywords in the ISO 19115 - Geographic Information Metadata (http://www.isotc211.org/) Topic Category Code List. It is a high-level geographic data thematic classification to assist in the grouping and search of available geographic data sets.  |MC |MC

|Data Center |The *<Data Center>* is the data center, organization, or institution responsible for distributing the data. |M |MC

|Summary |The *<Summary>* field provides a brief description of the data set along with the purpose of the data. This allows potential users to determine if the data set is useful for their needs. |MU |M

|Metadata Name |The ISO 19115 *<Metadata_Name>* field is used to identify the current DIF standard name. |MU |MC

|Metadata Version |The *<Metadata_Version>* field is used to identify the current DIF metadata standard. |MU |MU

|Data Set Citation |The *<Data_Set_Citation>* field allows the author to properly cite the data set producer. |R |R

|Personnel |*<Personnel>* defines the point of contact for more information about the data set or the metadata. |R |R

|Instrument |The Instrument or *<Sensor_Name>* is the name of the instrument used to acquire the data. |RC |RC

|Platform |The Platform or *<Source_Name>* is the name of the platform used to acquire the data. |RC |RC

|Temporal Coverage |The *<Temporal_Coverage>* field specifies the start and stop dates during which the data was collected. |R |M

|Paleo-Temporal Coverage |For paleoclimate or geologic data, *<Paleo_Temporal_Coverage>* is the length of time represented by the
data collected. |R |O

|Spatial Coverage |The *<Spatial_Coverage>* field specifies the geographic and vertical (altitude, depth) coverage of the data. |R |M

|Location |The *<Location>* field specifies the name of a place on Earth, a location within the Earth, a vertical location, or a location outside of Earth. |RC |OC

|Data Resolution |The *<Data_Resolution>* field specifies the resolution of the data, which is the difference between two adjacent geographic, vertical, or temporal values. Controlled keywords representing horizontal, vertical and temporal data resolution ranges can be selected. Selection of data resolution ranges will assist users in refining their search for data within specific resolution ranges. |RC |OC

|Project |The *<Project>* is the name of the scientific program, field campaign, or project from which the data were collected. |R |RC

|Quality |The *<Quality>* field allows the author to provide information about the quality of the data or any quality assurance procedures followed in producing the data described in the metadata. |R |MC

|Access Constraints |The *<Access_Constraints>* field allows the author to provide information about any constraints for accessing the data set.  |R |MC

|Use Constraints |The *<Use_Constraints>* field allows the author to describe how the data may or may not be used after access is granted to assure the protection of privacy or intellectual property. |R |MC

|Distribution |The *<Distribution>* field describes media options, size, data format, and fees involved in distributing the data set. |R |RC

|Data Set Language |*<Data_Set_Language>* describes the language used in the preparation, storage, and description of the data. |RC |RC

|Data Set Progress |The *<Data_Set_Progress>* describes the production status of the data set regarding its completeness.  |RC |RC

|Related URL |The *<Related_URL>* field specifies links to Internet sites that contain information related to the data, as well as related Internet sites such as project home pages, related data archives/servers, metadata extensions, online software packages, web mapping services, and calibration/validation data. |RC |MCfootnote:[Further guidelines are required compared to GCMD.]

|DIF Revision History |The *<DIF_Revision_History>* allows the author to provide a list of changes made to the DIF over time. |R |R

|Keyword (ancillary keywords) |The *<Keyword>* field allows authors to provide any words or phrases needed to further describe the data set. |R |R

|Originating Center |The *<Originating_Center>* is the data center or data producer who originally generated the dataset. |R |R

|Multimedia Sample |The *<Multimedia_Sample>* field allows the author to provide information that will enable the display of a sample image, movie or sound clip within the DIF. |R |O

|References (Publications) |The <**Reference>** field describes key
bibliographic citations pertaining to the data set. |R |R

|Parent DIF |The *<Parent_DIF>* field allows the capability to relate generalized aggregated metadata records (parents) to metadata records with highly specific information (children). Population of the *<Parent_DIF>* field should be reserved for instances where many metadata records are basically subsets that can be better represented by one parent metadata record, which describes the entire collection.  Typically, the parent metadata record will have many children metadata records, which refer to the parent through the *<Parent_DIF>* field. In some instances, a child may point to more than one parent. The *<Parent_DIF>* is populated with an *<Entry_ID>. * |R |O

|IDN Node |The Internal Directory Name (IDN) Node *(<IDN_Node>*) field is used internally to identify association, responsibility and/or ownership of the dataset, service or supplemental information. |R |O

|DIF Creation Date |The *<DIF_Creation_Date>* specifies the date the metadata record was created. |R |R

|Last DIF Revision Date |The *<Last_DIF_Revision_Date>* specifies the date the metadata record was created. |R |R

|Future DIF Review Date |The *<Future_DIF_Review_Date>* allows for the specification of a future date at which the DIF should be reviewed for accuracy of scientific or technical content. |R |R

|Privacy Status |The *<Private>* field allows the author to restrict the data set description from being publicly available. |RC |RC

|Extended Metadata |The *<Extended_Metadata>* field will allow organizations to store user defined values within the metadata record without reusing existing GCMD defined metadata fields. |O |Ofootnote:[Depends on potential requirements within SDMS.]

Recommendation::
GCMD comes with a number of predefined controlled vocabularies that should be used in specific sections of the metadata. 
As indicated in the table above some sections are free text in GCMD while it is suggested to use controlled vocabularies in SDMS context.
Recommendation::
GCMD do not require a controlled vocabulary for the quality element. 
SDMS should to improve search resultsfootnote:[This work should relate to international activities in this field in the context of e.g. GEO, ICES, WMO etc. and must be coordinated within SDMS by the Terminology Team. ].
Recommendation::
Related_URL has several subtypes. The existing http://gcmdservices.gsfc.nasa.gov/static/kms/rucontenttype/rucontenttype.csv[list of type and subtype] must be used to allow the SIOS Data Portal to filter the purpose of the URLs provided. 
See <<related_informationdif>> and <<data_accessdif>> below for more information.
Recommendation::
All times must be encoded as ISO8601 either as YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
