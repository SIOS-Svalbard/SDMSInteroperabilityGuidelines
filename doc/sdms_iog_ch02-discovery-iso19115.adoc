===== ISO19115

ISO19115 is a information container that can be populated with several controlled vocabularies in some of the elements. The search model for the SIOS Data Portal is currently built around parameter descriptions using the GCMD Science Keywords <<#anchor-14,[16]>>. A mapping exist between Climate and Forecast standard names <<#anchor-15,[17]>> and GCMD Science Keywords. ISO 19115 is used by e.g. INSPIRE at the European level and WMO (WMO Core Profile <<#anchor-9,[10]>>) at the global level.

*Recommendation:*::  
ISO19115 records *must* at least state the unique id, temporal and spatial location, scientific content, responsible data centre and PI as well as links to the actual datafootnote:[This recommendation will be revisited. ]. Datasets without such specifications are not ingested in the catalogue.
*Recommendation:*::  
ISO19115 records *should* contain GCMD Science Keywords (with full hierarchy from Earth Science and using > as separator) or some other machine readable vocabulary following the FAIR guiding principles <<#anchor-22,[24]>>. The vocabulary used must be identified.
*Recommendation:*::  
For stations where it is relevant (e.g. stations contributing to WMO GCW through CryoNet) it is mandatory to have one keyword from the WMO CategoryCode list <<#anchor-16,[18]>>footnote:[There is currently no way of including this information in GCMD DIF, although a mapping to ISO TopicCategories may be used. ]. Relevant keywords for SDMS are e.g. weatherObservations, meteorology, hydrology, climatology, glaciology. In the context of SDMS alone, this is not a requirement.
*Recommendation*::
Metadata records *should* include information on the host data centre for the dataset.
*Recommendation:*::  
All times must be encoded as ISO8601.

NOTE: More details to be added on ISO19115 guidance. In particular on how to embed references to the vocabularies used and information on the data centre hosting the data.

<<iso19115-core-elements>> shows elements in ISO19115 and whether these are **M**andatory,
**R**ecommended or **O**ptional, as well as whether they are **U**nique
(only one occurrence allowed) and require utilisation of **C**ontrolled
vocabularies.

NOTE: SDMS interprets both gmd:MD_Metadata and gmi:MI_Metadata. 

NOTE: How to add dataset landing pages etc are still a bit fuzzy. SDMS still interprets dataSetURI as a dataset landing page, but this is deprecated in ISO. Some data centres put dataset landing pages in gmd:distributionInfo/gmd:MD_Distribution/gmd:transferOptions/gmd:MD_DigitalTransferOptions/gmd:onLine/gmd:CI_OnlineResource and use a combination of various elements like gmd:function/gmd:CI_OnLineFunctionCode, gmd:name/gco:CharacterString to identify relevant additional information. SDMS is currently interpreting phrases like "Extended human readable information about the dataset" and "Landing page" as Dataset landing pages when found. Information tagged "Project on RiS" is translated into the category Other documentation and "Homepage" is interpreted as a project home page reference. More details need to be agreed on this.

NOTE: SDMS will extract name of the project that has generated the data from the descriptiveKeywords if these have gmd:type/gmd:MD_KeywordTypeCode set to 'project'. More details need to be agreed on this.

WARNING: The table below is under review.

|=======================================================================
|Element |Description |ISO |SDMS 

|gmd:fileIdentifier/gco:CharacterString | A unique identifier (A UUID with namespace is recommended) for the dataset. | | M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:citation/gmd:CI_Citation/gmd:title/gco:CharacterString |A short title for the dataset. |M |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:abstract |Short summary describing the dataset embedded in gco:CharacterString.  |M |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:extent/gmd:EX_Extent/gmd:temporalElement/gmd:EX_TemporalExtent/gmd:extent/gml:TimePeriod |Temporal extent of the dataset. Currently gaps are not handled. Relies on gml:beginPosition always to be present, if gml:endPosition is missing it is considered an ongoing observational effort. |M |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:extent/gmd:EX_Extent/gmd:geographicElement/gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox |Spatial extent of the dataset.  Requires all 4 corners (gmd:northBoundLatitude/gco:Decimal etc) of the BoundingBox to be set, also for point measurements. Points are interpreted if values are identical. |O |M

|gmd:contact/gmd:CI_ResponsibleParty |In this field information about the metadata author should be provided as the ISO standard specifies that this element should cover the “party responsible for the metadata information”. |O |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:pointOfContact/gmd:CI_ResponsibleParty|This field is used to identify personnel with various roles in relation to the dataset. It should as far as possible also include contact information, at least email address and affiliated institution, role (see below) and name. Extraction and crediting people involved relies on gmd:role/gmd:CI_RoleCode to have attribute codeListValue set according to a predefined set of values. ISO codes principalInvestigator, pointOfContact, and author are translated into roles of Principal Investigator, Technical Contact, Metadata Author respectively. Roles not listed above are translated into Technical Contact. |O |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:descriptiveKeywords/gmd:MD_Keywords/gmd:keyword/gco:CharacterString |A word or phrase that describes some aspect of a resource. Can be one of several types. It is used to describe the parameters in a dataset, the project affiliation etc. Proper identification of the purpose of the keywords and the vocabularies used is required. Project names are used to tag datasets in the SDMS system, e.g. as SIOS Core Data, SESS 2020 etc. If the keyword starts with 'EARTH SCIENCE &gt;' keywords are extracted and put in a separate list for GCMD keywords and used in the search interface. The full path of GCMD science keywords including '&gt;' is required. |O |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:language |Should be English. |M |M

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:topicCategory/gmd:MD_TopicCategoryCode| ISO Topic Category. |O |MC

|Distribution format |Should be NetCDF/CF or Darwin Core Archive in SDMS. Other standardised formats may be supported later. Non standard formats should have a detailed product manual. |O |M

|Spatial representation type | |O |RC

|Lineage |What is done with the data since collection. |O |R

|gmd:distributionInfo/gmd:MD_Distribution/gmd:transferOptions/gmd:MD_DigitalTransferOptions/gmd:onLine/gmd:CI_OnlineResource |URL to the actual dataset accompanied with identification of the protocol supported.  This implies that elements gmd:protocol/gco:CharacterString and gmd:linkage/gmd:URL must be set and the gmd:protocol contains a predefined keywordfootnote:[OSGEO or GCMD keywords are required for proper interpretation. More details to be added for this. These keywords are translated in the harvesting routine.]. This is used both to identify direct download of datasets (i.e. HTTP or FTP) as well as services on top of dataset (e.g. OPeNDAP, OGC WMS). It is important to note that direct download should not refer to a website requiring manual intervention. Direct download will be handled by the basket in the data portal and enables bundling of data for download etc.|O |MC

|Metadata character set | |O |RC

|Metadata point of contact | |M |M

|gmd:dateStamp | Last date of updated metadata using the form YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ |M |MC

|gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/gmd:resourceConstraints/gmd:MD_LegalConstraints/gmd:useLimitation | License for the metadata using https://spdx.org/licenses/[SPDX License List]. The identifier (adhering to the SPDX formatting) goes into gmx:Anchor and the link to the text into  the attribute of this xlink:href. This is currently a recommended field, but it is strongly recommended and suggested to become mandatory in the future. |O | R

|gmd:distributionInfo/gmd:MD_Distribution/gmd:distributor/gmd:MD_Distributor |The host data center of the dataset. This should have both a long and short name, but only specification for the long name is currently identified. The long name goes into gmd:distributorContact/gmd:CI_ResponsibleParty/gmd:organisationName/gco:CharacterString and the URL for the data center into gmd:distributorContact/gmd:CI_ResponsibleParty/gmd:contactInfo/gmd:CI_Contact/gmd:onlineResource/gmd:CI_OnlineResource/gmd:linkage/gmd:URL. More information to be added. |O |M
