===== ISO19115

ISO19115 is an information container that can be populated with several controlled vocabularies in some of the elements. 
The search model for the SIOS Data Portal is currently built around parameter descriptions using the GCMD Science Keywords <<RD-17>>. 
A mapping exists between Climate and Forecast standard names <<RD-18>> and GCMD Science Keywords. 
ISO 19115 is used by e.g. INSPIRE at the European level and WMO (WMO Core Profile <<RD-11>>) at the global level.

[horizontal]
Requirement::  
ISO19115 records *must* at least state the unique id, temporal and spatial locations, scientific content, responsible data centre and PI as well as links to the actual datafootnote:[This recommendation will be revisited. ]. Datasets without such specifications are not ingested in the catalogue.
Requirement::  
All times *must* be encoded as ISO8601.
Recommendation::  
ISO19115 records *should* contain GCMD Science Keywords (with full hierarchy from Earth Science and using > as separator) or some other machine readable vocabulary following the FAIR guiding principles <<RD-25>>. 
The vocabulary used must be identified.
Recommendation::  
For stations where it is relevant (e.g. stations contributing to WMO GCW through CryoNet) it is mandatory to have one keyword from the WMO CategoryCode list <<RD-19>>footnote:[There is currently no way of including this information in GCMD DIF, although a mapping to ISO TopicCategories may be used. ]. Relevant keywords for SDMS are e.g. weatherObservations, meteorology, hydrology, climatology, glaciology. In the context of SDMS alone, this is not a requirement.
Recommendation::
Metadata records *should* include information on the host data centre for the dataset.

////
This table is removed for the time being, using the mapping table instead
<<iso19115-core-elements>> shows elements in ISO19115 and whether these are **M**andatory,
**R**ecommended or **O**ptional, as well as whether they are **U**nique
(only one occurrence allowed) and require utilisation of **C**ontrolled
vocabularies.
////

NOTE: SDMS interprets both gmd:MD_Metadata (ISO 19115-1) and gmi:MI_Metadata (ISO 19115-2). The mdb:MD_Metadata (ISO 19115-3) is not supported.

//// 
This is now in the table below.
NOTE: SDMS will extract name of the project that has generated the data from the descriptiveKeywords if these have gmd:type/gmd:MD_KeywordTypeCode set to 'project'. More details need to be agreed on this.

Below is a mapping table between the internal metadata model described in <<discovery-model-elements>> and the ISO19115 elements.

[#keywordsiso]
====== Keywords and vocabulary

The following approach is currently used for keywords and vocabularies:

* parsing of keyword type in gmd:type/gmd:MD_KeywordTypeCode/@codeListValue is performed looking for the values 'theme' or 'project' to fill the keywords or project elements in the internal metadata model
* parsing of thesauri in gmd:thesaurusName/gmd:CI_Citation/gmd:title is performed looking for GEMET or CF Standard names
* parsing of gmd:keyword/gco:CharacterString or gmd:keyword/gmx:Anchor is performed for GEMET and CF Standard names
* parsing of gmd:keyword/gco:CharacterString starting with 'EARTH SCIENCE &gt;' is used to discriminate GCMD Science keywords. The full path of the GCMD science keywords including '&gt;' is required.


[#use_constraintsiso]
====== Use constraints

The recommended way to provide a license is:
[source,xml]
----
<gmx:Anchor xlink:href="http://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0">CC-BY-4.0</gmx:Anchor>
----

Where the identifier (adhering to the SPDX formatting) goes into gmx:Anchor and the link to the text into the attribute of this xlink:href. This is currently a recommended field, but it is strongly recommended and  suggested to become mandatory in the future.
Licenses that cannot be mapped to standard licenses will be parsed as text. Some mapping stragegy is also in place during harvesting license.footnote:[An internal mapping is done upon harvesting to parse license title or exact maching urls. If provided, a gco:CharacterString can also parsed.]

[#related_informationiso]
====== Related information (URLs)

Links to related information can be quite difficult to parse due to the degrees of freedom in ISO.
The internal model is supporting related information of different types based on the https://vocab.met.no/mmd/Related_Information_Types[Related Information Types] controlled list.
Currently:

* SDMS still interprets gmd:dataSetURI as a "Dataset landing page", but this is deprecated in ISO.
* gmd:distributionInfo/gmd:MD_Distribution/gmd:transferOptions/gmd:MD_DigitalTransferOptions/gmd:onLine/gmd:CI_OnlineResource
and a combination of gmd:function/gmd:CI_OnLineFunctionCode/@codeListValue='information' and
gmd:name/gco:CharacterString can also be used to identify a dataset landing page.
SDMS is currently interpreting phrases like "Extended human readable information about the dataset" and "Landing page" as URL of type "Dataset landing page" when found.
* Information tagged "Project on RiS" is translated into the category "Other documentation"
* "Homepage" is interpreted as a "Project home page" reference.

[#data_accessiso]
====== Data access

The gmd:protocol containing a predefined keywordfootnote:[OSGEO or GeoNetwork keywords are required for proper interpretation. These keywords are translated in the harvesting routine.] and the gmd:linkage/gmd:URL are used to parse the different data access links.
This is used both to identify direct download of datasets (i.e. HTTP or FTP) as well as services on top of dataset (e.g. OPeNDAP, OGC WMS).
It is important to note that direct download should not refer to a website requiring manual intervention. Direct download will be handled by the basket in the data portal and enables bundling of data for download etc.

Below the list of currently mapped protocols:
